# 🌊 Stability of Floating Bodies – ME303 Thermo-Fluid Lab  

📘 *Course: Thermo-Fluid Lab (ME303)*  
🏫 Institution: IIT Ropar  
📅 Duration: Semester Project  

---

## 📖 Overview  
This project investigates the **stability of floating bodies** by analyzing buoyancy, metacenter, metacentric height, and the center of gravity.  
Two major components of the project include:  
1. **Experimental Analysis** – Determining the metacenter and metacentric height of a floating body.  
2. **Design Project** – Creating a prototype of a floating body with **adjustable buoyancy**, capable of varying its submersion fraction in real-time.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand the concept of **buoyancy** and its role in floating body stability.  
- Measure and locate the **metacenter (M)** and **center of gravity (G)**.  
- Calculate **metacentric height (GM)** and evaluate its effect on stability.  
- Design and test a **floating body with adjustable buoyancy** using a dual-pump system.  

---

## 🧩 Theoretical Background  
- **Buoyancy**: Upward force equal to the weight of displaced water (Archimedes’ Principle).  
- **Metacenter (M)**: Point where the line of buoyant force intersects the body’s centerline when tilted.  
- **Metacentric Height (GM)**: Distance between G and M, a key stability parameter.  
  - **Positive GM** → Stable condition.  
  - **Negative GM** → Unstable condition.  
- **Center of Gravity (G)**: Determines the response of a floating body to external forces.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
### 1. Stability Experiment  
- A model floating body was used with tilting measurement apparatus.  
- Center of gravity was varied using additional weights.  
- Body was tilted gradually, and data was collected to calculate **GM**.  

### 2. Adjustable Buoyancy Design  
- **Floating body** constructed using PVC pipe (27 cm length, 16 cm diameter).  
- **Acrylic sheets** sealed ends; total volume ≈ **5.4 L**.  
- **Two pumps** (inlet & outlet) controlled water inside the hollow compartment.  
- **Control mechanism** allowed real-time adjustments between **10% – 90% submersion**.  
- Low **center of gravity** ensured stability during adjustments.
